Not far into my academic career, I had a fruitful start: During my masters research (on bayesian election auditing) at unimelb I had the opportunity to publish work and present at two international conferences, one even in person at austria. I also had the opportunity to develop open source software and publish my first R package on CRAN (elections.dtree).

Then, I worked for a year as a research assistant (where I published a second package `prefio` to CRAN) and a software developer.

Now, I've just started my PhD at Monash university. I'm still quite early on in my academic journey, but I hope it continues to be as eventful as it has been so far

# Election Auditing

## Two steps

- Data collection
  - Voters submit **ballots** $\{b_i\}_{i=1}^N$

- *"Social choice"*
  - Calculate the winner(s) among **candidates** $\mathcal{C}$

## Auditing

- A potentially dubious outcome is reported
  - Candidate $C \in \mathcal{C}$ reported to have won
- **How can we verify this outcome?**

::: {.notes}
Following the election, an audit aims to uncover and correct any error.
In short, a reported outcome is given and we want to prove or disprove this claim.
:::


## Idea 1

- Check every ballot cast in the election and re-count

::::: {.incremental}
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Pros:
  - Guaranteed to correct errors
  - Creates jobs
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Cons:
  - Expensive
  - Fellow statisticians out of work
  - **Boring**
:::

::::
:::::

::: {.notes}
The most straightforward way to audit an election is to simply re-count the ballots by hand until you can prove the outcome.

While simplistic, this is the only way to correct an incorrect reported outcome with 100% probability.

This would create many jobs as the electoral body would need many counters.

But of course it would be extremely expensive

If everyone did this, I'd have to find a new topic for my PhD thesis

The most important reason not to do this:
it's pretty boring, and there is a distinct lack of fun statistics tricks
:::


## Auditing (reprise)

- A potentially dubious outcome is reported
  - Candidate $C \in \mathcal{C}$ reported to have won

::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
- **How can we verify this outcome?**
:::


::: {.incremental}
- **How can we verify this outcome *using statistics*?**
  - **Efficient**
    - Outcome supported $\rightarrow$ stop early w.h.p!
  - **Low Risk**
    - Outcome incorrect $\rightarrow$ proceed to full recount w.h.p!
:::

::: {.notes}
If the reported outcome is correct, we want our statistical audit to stop as early as possible:
* Checking fewer ballots
* Costing less time and money

If the reported outcome is incorrect, we want our statistical audit to proceed to a full recount with high probability.
:::

## Idea 2

- Construct a sequential hypothesis test
  - Choose statistic(s) which evaluates how strongly the data supports the reported outcome
  - Keep sampling until the statistic sufficiently supports the reported outcome
  - Otherwise, conduct full recount

::: {.notes}
If the reported outcome is incorrect, we will need to proceed to a full recount anyway.
:::


## Formally...

- Set-up:
  - $\text{H}_0$: The reported outcome is false ($A$ doesn't win)
  - $\text{H}_1$: The reported outcome is true ($A$ does indeed win)

. . .

- Procedure
  - Sample ballots at random
  - Compute statistic based on what we've seen so far

## Bayesian audits

- Use Bayesian statistics to quantify current uncertainty
- Calculate posterior $\pi_n$ using current sample
- Use $\pi_n$ to find posterior probability of $\text{H}_1$ directly!


## Posterior $\pi_n$

```{r}
library(extraDistr)
alpha_n <- c(6, 4, 5)
TernaryPlot(atip="A", btip="B", ctip="C", axis.labels = FALSE, axis.tick = FALSE)
TernaryContour(function(p1, p2, p3) ddirichlet(cbind(p1, p2, p3), alpha=alpha_n), resolution = 100L, filled = TRUE)
TernaryLines(list(c(0.5, 0.5, 0), c(1/3, 1/3, 1/3), c(0.5, 0, 0.5)), col="orange", lwd=3)
```

## Monte-carlo integration

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
alpha_n <- c(6, 4, 5)
N <- 1000
TernaryPlot(atip="A", btip="B", ctip="C", axis.labels = FALSE, axis.tick = FALSE)
TernaryPolygon(list(c(1,0,0), c(1/2, 1/2, 0), c(1/3,1/3,1/3), c(1/2, 0, 1/2)), col = "#EEEEEE")
TernaryPolygon(list(c(1/2,1/2,0), c(1/3, 1/3, 1/3), c(1/2,0,1/2), c(0, 0, 1), c(0, 1, 0)), col = "#AAAAAA")
pts <- rdirichlet(N, alpha = alpha_n)
TernaryPoints(pts, col = "blue", pch = ".")
text(0, 0.7, expression("H"[1]), col = "black")
text(0, 0.1, expression("H"[0]), col = "black")

tab <- table(pts[,1] > 1/3)/N
names(tab) <- c("Post. P(H0)", "Post. P(H1)")
barplot(tab)
```

::: {.notes}
Using the model, we take draws from the posterior and we can count how many simulations support the null, how many support the alternative.
Then, we can derive posterior probabilities for the null and alternative and stop auditing when we are satisfied.
:::


## Different elections

- Bayesian audit supports a variety of elections easily:
- Given a model:
  - Simulate outcome
  - Does it support $\text{H}_1$?
  - Repeat

::: {.notes}
This works for any social choice function, even IRV!
:::

## Shortcomings

- No straightforward way to control the **Risk** (Type I error)
  - The probability of rejecting $\text{H}_0$, even though it is true
  - Can estimate for some contests by studying worst-case scenarios

# Example in `R`: Wakehurst 2023

## The data

- March 2023: NSW holds election for Legislative Assembly
- Six candidates in the running for Wakehurst district:
  - WRIGHT Sue (ALP)
  - MAWSON Greg (SAP)
  - SORENSEN Susan (AJP)
  - HRNJAK Ethan (GRN)
  - WILLIAMS Toby (LIB)
  - REGAN Michael (IND)


## Results

Michael Regan (IND) beats Toby Williams (LIB) on preferences!

![Wakehurst 2023 Distribution of Preferences](./wakehurst-dop.png)

## Preparing the data

Download election data from [PrefLib](https://www.preflib.org/) using `prefio`:
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "1|2,3"
library(prefio) # My R package for working with preferential datasets
wakehurst <- read_preflib("nswla/00058-00000273.soi", from_preflib = TRUE)
head(wakehurst)
```

. . .

Shuffle the data to simulate an audit:
```{r}
#| echo: true
ballots <- sample(as.preferences(wakehurst))
```

## Conducting an audit

Specify a prior:
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "1|3,4,5,6"
library(elections.dtree) # My R package implementing Bayesian audits for IRV

pi <- dirichlet_tree$new(
  candidates = names(ballots),
  a0 = 1. # "Uniform" prior
)
```

## Prior probabilities for $\text{H}_{0,i},\ \text{H}_1$

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "2|3|4|"
prob_post <- pi$sample_posterior(
  n_elections = 10000,         # Number of monte-carlo draws from the posterior
  n_ballots = length(ballots), # Number of ballots cast in election
  n_threads = 4                # Specify number of threads to use
)

barplot(prob_post, xlab = "Candidate", ylab= "Posterior probability of winning",  cex.names=.7)
```
Uniform!

## Observe a small batch of ballots

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "1|3,4,5,6,7|"
pi$update(ballots[1:10])

prob_post <- pi$sample_posterior(
  n_elections = 10000,         # Number of monte-carlo draws from the posterior
  n_ballots = length(ballots), # Number of ballots cast in election
  n_threads = 4                # Specify number of threads to use
)

barplot(prob_post, xlab = "Candidate", ylab= "Posterior probability of winning",  cex.names=.7)
```

## and another...

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "1|3,4,5,6,7|"
pi$update(ballots[11:20])

prob_post <- pi$sample_posterior(
  n_elections = 10000,         # Number of monte-carlo draws from the posterior
  n_ballots = length(ballots), # Number of ballots cast in election
  n_threads = 4                # Specify number of threads to use
)

barplot(prob_post, xlab = "Candidate", ylab= "Posterior probability of winning",  cex.names=.7)
```

##

```{r}
#| echo: false
batcher_factory <- function() {
  batch_size <- 100
  i <- 0
  function() {
    bs <- ballots[(batch_size * i + 1):(batch_size*(i+1))]
    i <<- i + 1
    return(bs)
  }
}
batch <- batcher_factory()

pi$update(batch())
prob_post <- pi$sample_posterior(
  n_elections = 10000,         # Number of monte-carlo draws from the posterior
  n_ballots = length(ballots), # Number of ballots cast in election
  n_threads = 4                # Specify number of threads to use

  n_elections = 10000,         # Number of monte-carlo draws from the posterior
  n_ballots = length(ballots), # Number of ballots cast in election
  n_threads = 4                # Specify number of threads to use

  n_ballots = length(ballots), # Number of ballots cast in election
  n_threads = 4                # Specify number of threads to use

## Tracing the probabilities over time

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(ggplot2)
